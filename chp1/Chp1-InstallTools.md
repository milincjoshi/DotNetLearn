### Downloading and installing Visual Studio Code and Extensions
1.	Download and install either the Stable build or the Insiders edition of Visual Studio Code from the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/.
    More Information: If you need more help installing Visual Studio Code, you can read the official setup guide at the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview.
2.	Download and install the .NET SDKs for versions 3.1, 5.0, and 6.0 from the following link: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download.
    To fully learn how to control .NET SDKs, we need multiple versions installed. .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5.0, and .NET 6.0 are the three currently supported versions. You can safely install multiple ones side by side. 
    You will learn how to target the one you want throughout this book. 
3.	To install the C# extension, you must first launch the Visual Studio Code application.
4.	In Visual Studio Code, click the Extensions icon or navigate to View | Extensions.
5.	C# is one of the most popular extensions available, so you should see it at the top of the list, or you can enter C# in the search box.
6.	Click Install and wait for supporting packages to download and install.
7.	Enter .NET Interactive in the search box to find the .NET Interactive Notebooks extension.
8.	Click Install and wait for it to install.
